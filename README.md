## My process

1. I built out the mark up using semantic HTML 
2. I used CSS to style and make the ui lookm beautifull

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow



### What I learned

I leaned how to lay elements out both horizontal and a vertical axis to cretae a beautifull design, this will help me when it comes to me doing more complex layouts with the grid system.

### Continued development

I will focuss onb more challenges like this and different ones moving forward, hopefully eventually get on to creating really complex layouts.
